Interactive 3D three body simulation with contact dynamics.

- Select different bodies and change their size/mass, which changes the gravitational dynamics. 
- Contained within a little sphere world that illuminates with contact. Three body simulations typically fly really far apart from each other after some time. The boundardy bounces the bodies back towards each other to keep the simulation interesting.
- Change the speed of the simulation.  
- 4 different views.
- 3 different tail visualizations.
- Lighting and textures will be implimented in the future.  

My starting point was the sample code on the sample branch.
